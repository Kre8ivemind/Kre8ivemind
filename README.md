 @Kre8ivemind
I am an aspiring Web Developer building my foundational education, with HTML, CSS, and javascript under my belt. Looking to master the art and build a portfolio to transition out of my current career at UPS.

- I fell in love with programming when i first started learning how the world works(finance world). The mass amounts of work
  that goes into building a website, simple functionalities and overlooked conveniences that the every day individual takes for granted really intrigued and motivated to be apart of it.
- The amount of satisfaction from building a working application is seemingly unmatched. My previous hobby for most of my life was riding BMX and apart from the physical demand they are very much the same when it comes to trial and error! 

- For my long term Development goals i’m aiming blockchain/ smart contracts/ data storage, computational storage and communication.
 
blockchain development and smart contracts are the future!
