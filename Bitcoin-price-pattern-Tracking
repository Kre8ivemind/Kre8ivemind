    <h2> The prices of markets rise and fall for many reasons and at varying rates. But did you know that if you do the math you can tell whats going to happen to the more certain degree of conviction ? Lets run some numbers and see what happpens!</h2>
    
    <h3>Do these result numbers mean anything? We will just have to find out and look back as a refernce.</h3>
    <p>The math will have to be redone yearly to be most accurate. A reflection from the results back to this chart will tell us all the most predictable pattern.</p>

<h3>Now add 83+83+73, and then divide by 3.</h3>

<p>Now your answer should be around 79.66%, this is our average drop from new all time high to the new bottom. So if we are to make a predicition based off of this average the new low would fall from anywhere between $11,493 to $14,198</p>
<h3>OUTLIER FACTORS</h3>
<p>Now we cant rely on the pattern alone to make a accurate prediction, they're many complex parts moving at the same time.<a href="https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tLP1TfIijcuMrU0YPTizUotys9NVSjIL0_NyQEAbsoIqQ&q=jerome+powell&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS961US961&oq=jerome+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46i433i512j46i131i199i433i465i512j46i433i512l2j46i131i433i512j46i433i512j46i131i433i512j46i175i199i512j0i271.2903j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Jerome Powell</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve">Federal Reserve</a> play a crucial roll in making and breaking the global markets.
